# Sigma Rizzler

A simple game about Sigma and Rizz. It's about as brainrot as you can think.

## How to Compile
1. Clone this repo
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/mybday123/sigma-rizzler
    ```
2. Run make to compile the game
    ```
    $ make
    ```
    If you want to compile on a different operating system, you can append `CC=<yourcompiler>` to `make`. For example, compiling to Windows using MinGW:
    ```
    $ make CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
    ```

The compiled binary name is `sigma`. On Linux, you can run the game by typing `./sigma` into your shell.
